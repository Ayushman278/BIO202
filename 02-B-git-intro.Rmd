In this lesson you will learn how to:

+ Create and use a GitHub account to collaborate on our course website
+ Set up a version-controlled RStudio project on your computer
+ Use git to track and manage changes to files on your computer from RStudio
+ Send changes to (local) files on your computer to a (remote) GitHub repository


```{r include = FALSE}
# This code block sets up the r session when the page is rendered to html
# include = FALSE means that it will not be included in the html document

# Write every code block to the html document 
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)

# Write the results of every code block to the html document 
knitr::opts_chunk$set(eval = TRUE)

# Define the directory where images generated by knit will be saved
knitr::opts_chunk$set(fig.path = "images/")

# Set the web address where R will look for files from this repository
# Do not change this address
repo_url <- "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fukamilab/BIO202/master/"
```


# Before we begin

Make sure that you have installed git on your computer. You will need both the program git and a command line shell to use the program. See the git installation instructions on the [Computer Setup](00-computer-setup.html) page. We will primarily focus on using git from RStudio.
