```{r include = FALSE}
# This code block sets up the r session when the page is rendered to html
# include = FALSE means that it will not be included in the html document

# Write every code block to the html document 
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)

# Write the results of every code block to the html document 
knitr::opts_chunk$set(eval = TRUE)

# Define the directory where images generated by knit will be saved
knitr::opts_chunk$set(fig.path = "images/")

# Set the web address where R will look for files from this repository
# Do not change this address
