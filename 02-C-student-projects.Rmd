**Effects of anthropogenic disturbance on the structure of species interaction networks**

How does anthropogenic disturbance affect the structure of species interaction networks? We (Beth and I) have compiled a database of ~30 published datasets which examine changes in network structure across different levels of disturbance. Each dataset consists of two or more species interaction networks measured at study sites exhibiting different levels of anthropogenic disturbance (such as fragmentation, defaunation, invasive species, etc.). We will use network analysis to quantify the structure of each network, and then use meta-analytical techniques to draw conclusions about the general effects of distrubance on network structure across the ~30 datasets.
